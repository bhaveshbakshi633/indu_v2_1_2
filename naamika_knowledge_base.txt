## SSi MANTRA 3 - DETAILED SYSTEM SPECIFICATIONS

### MSRS (Mantra Surgical Robotic System) Overview

The MANTRA Surgical Robotic System (MSRS) is a novel robotic system designed and developed by Sudhir Srivastava Innovations (SS Innovations or SSI) to perform Robotic Minimally Invasive Surgery. It is a teleoperated Robotically Assisted Surgical System (RASS) designed to assist surgeons in performing minimally invasive surgery and to overcome challenges associated with currently available systems.

### FOUR MAJOR COMPONENTS OF SSi MANTRA SYSTEM

The SSi Mantra surgical robotic system has FOUR main components:

1. SURGEON COMMAND CENTER (SCC) - The surgeon's control station with 3D HD monitor, hand controllers, foot pedals, and ergonomic seating where the surgeon operates from

2. ROBOTIC ARM PATIENT CARTS - 3 to 5 modular robotic arms that hold and manipulate the surgical instruments near the patient

3. VISION CART - Houses the endoscopic camera system, System Control Box, 3D monitors for surgical team, UPS power supply, and connects all system components

4. MUDRA INSTRUMENTS - The robotic endo-surgical instruments (scissors, graspers, needle drivers, cautery tools) that perform the actual surgery

### HOW SSi MANTRA SURGERY WORKS - STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

**PREPARATION PHASE:**
Patient is prepared and positioned on the operating table. Anesthesia is administered by the anesthesiologist. Small incisions, usually 5-10mm, are made for minimally invasive access. Robotic arms are positioned and connected to the patient cart near the surgical site. The endoscopic camera is inserted to provide 3D HD visualization of the surgical field.

**SURGERY PHASE:**
The surgeon sits comfortably at the Surgeon Command Center away from the patient. The surgeon views the surgical site through a 3D HD monitor with magnified view. The surgeon controls the MUDRA instruments using hand controllers with natural wrist-like movements. The robotic arms translate the surgeon's hand movements into precise micro-movements inside the patient. The system filters out hand tremors for ultra-precise control. The additional surgical team monitors the patient-side and assists as needed. The camera provides clear 3D visualization throughout the procedure.

**POST-SURGERY PHASE:**
Once surgery is complete, instruments are withdrawn. Small incisions are closed with minimal scarring. Patients typically recover faster due to the minimally invasive approach, experiencing less pain, shorter hospital stays, and quicker return to normal activities.

**KEY ADVANTAGES:**
Surgeons have enhanced precision with 7 degrees of freedom movement. The minimally invasive approach means smaller incisions and less trauma. 3D HD visualization provides superior view of the surgical site. Ergonomic design reduces surgeon fatigue for better outcomes. Made in India technology makes it affordable and accessible worldwide.

###SURGICAL SPECIALIZATIONS AND PROCEDURES

**CARDIAC SURGERY (PRIMARY SPECIALTY):**
SSi Mantra excels in cardiac procedures including coronary artery bypass grafting, valve repairs, valve replacements, beating heart TECAB surgeries, and minimally invasive cardiac procedures. Doctor Srivastava personally performed over 1,300 beating heart TECAB surgeries using SSi Mantra.

**OTHER SURGICAL SPECIALTIES:**
The system is used across multiple specializations including general surgery, gynecological procedures, thoracic surgery, urological procedures, and gastrointestinal surgeries. SSi Mantra's versatility allows surgeons to perform complex procedures across different surgical domains with precision and control.

**COMPLEX PROCEDURES:**
Some of the most complex surgeries performed include beating heart coronary artery bypass, mitral valve repairs, robotic-assisted cardiac procedures, multi-vessel coronary bypass, and minimally invasive cardiac surgeries. The system has successfully completed over 7,800 robotic surgeries globally.

#### Complete System Architecture
The complete MSRS system consists of:
- Patient-side manipulators (3 to 5 robotic arms)
- Surgeon Command Center (SCC)
- Vision Cart with System Control Box
- Robotic surgical instruments (MUDRA)
- Accessories and sterile components

#### Key Benefits for Patients
- More precise surgery near healthy, sensitive organs, tissues, and nerves
- Significantly less pain
- Less risk of infection and blood loss due to tiny incisions
- Earlier discharge from the hospital (sometimes next day)
- Less scarring and shorter recovery
- Better clinical outcomes in many cases

#### Key Benefits for Surgeons
- Enhanced visual field with high-definition magnified 3D view
- Superior dexterity - robotic instruments exceed the range of motion of the human hand
- Arms can rotate a full 360 degrees
- Access to hard-to-reach places
- Open-console ergonomic design reduces fatigue
- Better posture for long surgeries
